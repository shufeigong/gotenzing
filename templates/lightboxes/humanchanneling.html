                                The Canadian Mental Health Association wanted to

                                re-invigorate its base as Tenzing rebuilt the CMHA

                                brand and carved out a unique space in Canadian

                                healthcare. A simple Facebook page and online

                                mental health quiz engaged the CMHA Human

                                a total of 300 friends to over 10,000 in just a few

                                Research tells us that one of the primary drivers

                                behind mental illness stigmatization is a group

                                comprised of healthcare professionals and staff.

                                When launching its new $2 Billion mental health and

                                addiction facility in Hamilton, St Joe's decided to

                                tackle internal stigmatization through the In-Our-

                                House program. By inspiring over 3,000 employees to

                                register in the fight against stigma, St. Joe's created

                                its own Human Channel.

                                    St Thomas, Ontario was close to being a

                                    manufacturing ghost town. Tenzing helped the

                                    municipality create a new industrial revolution in

                                    response. In just a few weeks, a campaign video

                                    inspired 10,000 YouTube 'likes' based on a

                                    community launch. A U.S. city (10 x the size of St.

                                    Thomas) launched a similar video and inspired fewer

                                    than 1,000 likes in six months. The St. Thomas

                                    Human Channelâ„¢ was the difference.
