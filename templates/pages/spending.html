            We don't watch the clock. We don't do time sheets.

            We don't have handlers and overseers. We are

            teams. We are seamless between disciplines: digital

            and traditional, strategy and deployment, design and

            content, between joy and jumping off-grid for

            weekends. For all these reasons, spending time and

            budget with Tenzing is a more rewarding experience.

            Russell Investments wanted a global brand that would

            speak to all cultures in all markets and be flexible

            enough to adapt as markets changed. Projects like

            this often take on a life of their own and seem never-

            ending. Tenzing helped Russell (Seattle) move from a

            stand-still to a working solution in about a month.
