        Years ago, two smart guys (Al Ries & Jack Trout)

        wrote a book about positioning. In a world now filled

        to the ozone with undifferentiated, competing

        products and services, and endless, fragmented

        media tactics, their advice is now biblical. We suggest

        you either practice the art of positioning for preference

        through differentiation or prepare to drop your

        margins.
