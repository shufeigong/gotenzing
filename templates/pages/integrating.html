        <p>
            Mastering all communications skills and media is not optional. Conversely, managing all kinds of different experts to orchestrate a single brand is only for the bloated (or bravely naive). The world is collaborative, dynamic and integrated. So is Tenzing: One team per client, delivering single-minded brands, design and content across all channels. In a world that is increasingly fragmented and cluttered, integration delivers seamless continuity. It reduces the effort and cost of being great. And as audiences slip quickly from channel to channel and screen to screen, integration guarantees consistency - the only way to ensure every message you create drives your audience to the same brand conclusion.
