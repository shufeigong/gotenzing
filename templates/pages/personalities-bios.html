                        We are moms and dads, brothers and sisters, partners and
                        spouses, runners and cultural activists, curious intellects,
                        simply curious, always interested, rarely still, canoeists and cyclists, educated and
                        street-tested, wonderfully diverse, writers and artists and thinkers all.
                        Tenzing culture is one of inclusion. And living fully is always the first
                        item on our to-do lists.
