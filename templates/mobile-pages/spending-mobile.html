                We don't watch the clock. We don't do time sheets.

                We don't have handlers and overseers. We are

                teams. We are seamless between disciplines: digital

                and traditional, strategy and deployment, design and

                content, between joy and jumping off-grid for

                weekends. For all these reasons, spending time and

                budget with Tenzing is a more rewarding experience.

                Russell Investments wanted a global brand that would

                speak to all cultures in all markets and be flexible

                enough to adapt as markets changed. Projects like

                this often take on a life of their own and seem never-

                ending. Tenzing helped Russell (Seattle) move from a

                stand-still to a working solution in about a month.
